# `markdown-document-seed`

A seed to create a tree of markdown documents. The editor of the document tree will be able to live-preview the markdown files in a browser while editing. The preview is unstyled HTML, but it will be customizable using [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configurations.

## Editing

Your prose should go in `content`. There already is `content\index.md`, which is filled with some sample text. Start by emptying it.
